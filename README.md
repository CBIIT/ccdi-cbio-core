# cbioportal-core
Legacy cBioPortal Core. Although many of the Java classes here are still in use by the main codebase and the `metaImport.py` Python scripts are still used for importing, we decided to move them all here for deprecating in the future once we have come up with a good plan for replacing them.

This repo contains:

- many old Java classes for interacting with the database
- The `metaImport.py` Python script used for importing
